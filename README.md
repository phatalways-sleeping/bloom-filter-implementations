# **Every Weeknd**

## **Description**

This repository contains the code for any project that I have worked on during my weekends. The projects are mostly small and are meant to be fun and educational.

## **Projects**

1. [**Spelling Checker Using Bloom Filter**](./contents/spelling-checker.md) - A spelling checker that uses a bloom filter to store the dictionary of words.

2. [**Weak Password Detector**](./contents/weak-password-detector.md) - A weak password detector that uses a bloom filter to store the dictionary of weak passwords.

## **Resources**

- Thanks to Coding Challenge for the inspiration for the spelling checker project. You can find the blog [here](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-53-bloom-filter)
